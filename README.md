# Rent-Buy Cars 
The main goal of this project is to build an easy-to-use platform where people can rent/buy cars, along with other options like extending, cancelling and selling their vehicles. 
# Description
Clients must sign in or create an account to buy/rent a car, they have a variety of vehicles to choose from. All of users' information is stored in the SQL server and passwords are stored encrypted using a hash for security reasons. The customer can also see what vehicles he bought/rented in the past and also has the option of selling the car, extending and cancelling the rent if they want to. The buttons for buying and renting the car are displayed along the car's description, the seats number and other information. The user can also change their name, password and add funds to their account. Personally, I wanted to learn more about Flask to become better at back-end technologies, Microsoft SQL Server since I have been using Oracle SQL for some time and I wanted to make a change, Python because it is compatible with Flask and it is a well-known language and Bootstrap CSS to make CSS design faster and better.
